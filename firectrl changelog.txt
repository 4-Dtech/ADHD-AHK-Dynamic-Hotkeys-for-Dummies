+ : Added feature

2.12 20th Sep 2013
* No real changes, just made UI bigger to accomodate "Functionality Toggle" which is now added to all macros by ADHD.

2.11 13th Sep 2013
+ Arm Lock now has it's own toggle.
  You no longer need to run two copies of Fire Control to have Arm Lock Toggle and Weapon Toggle at the same time.

2.10 6th Sep 2013
+ Added options 7-0 to Weapon Toggle group
  You can use this to allow "Weapon Toggle" to function as an "Arm Lock Toggle".
  eg program "Toggle Arm Lock" in MWO to 0 (Zero), replacing the shift binding.
  Then run a second copy of FC, and create a profile thus:
  Bindings - Weapon Toggle: Just tick the Shift box on the right - leave everything else on that row blank!
  Main - Set "Weapon Toggle Group" to 0, set "Scroll Lock Indicates..." option to NONE so it wont interfere with scroll lock light (Controlled by the 1st copy of FC).
  With that done, when you hit Shift in MWO, it will toggle arm lock status.
+ You can now run multiple copies of Fire Control by double clicking the icon twice.
! Do not try to have the same profile selected for both copies (The second copy will always start with the same profile selected, you need to change it)

2.9 30th Aug 2013
= Fire Rate (And scroll lock state if that is enabled) is now reset on exit to mechlab like Weapon Toggle is

2.8 27th Aug 2013
+ Uses new ADHD "Run as Admin" feature to ensure script is always running as admin

2.7 15th Aug 2013
+ You can now select what the Scroll Lock light is used for (Weapon Toggle, Fire Rate, or None)
  Setting to None should alleviate compatibility issues with SweetFX

2.6 11th Aug 2013
= If you bind fire to a keyboard button, it will no longer repeat if you hold the button down.
  If you had unexpected behaviour when firing with a keyboard key, this version may well fix things for you.
! The AHK version now defaults to including from the Autohotkey Lib folder (C:\Program Files\Autohokey\Lib by default)
! ADHD change:
  If none of the CTRL, Shift or Alt options in the Bindings tab are ticked for a binding,
  then it will work even if CTRL, Shift or Alt are held down
 
2.5 14th Jul 2013
= Now supports a string in Fire Sequence
So you could eg set fire sequence to hello,goodbye
Please note that all keys in string will not be sent together. They will be sent with delay specified by SetKeyDelay
Altering SetKeyDelay can affect whether the macro works in a game or not (eg less than 50ms wait before keyup does not work in MWO)

2.4 9th Jul 2013
= Limit fire rate option now actually works - previously it was always on.

2.3 7th Jul 2013
= Weapon Toggle now disables correctly again

2.2 7th Jul 2013
+ Now detects change of resolution and when it gets smaller, resets and shuts off all timers.
In games that have a windowed mode lobby and a full-screen game - this should shut stuff off when you go back to the lobby.

2.1 7th Jul 2013
= Fixed app detection.
Will now disable timers and Weapon Toggle when the Limit App loses focus

2.0 6th Jul 2013
* Initial Class Library version

1.x
* Initial dev versions, not recorded
