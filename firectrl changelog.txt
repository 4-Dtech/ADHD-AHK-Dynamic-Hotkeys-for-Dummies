2.5 14th Jul 2013
= Now supports a string in Fire Sequence
So you could eg set fire sequence to hello,goodbye
Please note that all keys in string will not be sent together. They will be sent with delay specified by SetKeyDelay
Altering SetKeyDelay can affect whether the macro works in a game or not (eg less than 50ms wait before keyup does not work in MWO)

= Limit fire rate option now actually works - previously it was always on.

2.3 7th Jul 2013
