= If you bind fire to a keyboard button, it will no longer repeat if you hold the button down.
  If you had unexpected behaviour when firing with a keyboard key, this version may well fix things for you.
! The AHK version now defaults to including from the Autohotkey Lib folder (C:\Program Files\Autohokey\Lib by default)
! ADHD change:
  If none of the CTRL, Shift or Alt options in the Bindings tab are ticked for a binding,
  then it will work even if CTRL, Shift or Alt are held down
 
2.5 14th Jul 2013
= Now supports a string in Fire Sequence
So you could eg set fire sequence to hello,goodbye
Please note that all keys in string will not be sent together. They will be sent with delay specified by SetKeyDelay
Altering SetKeyDelay can affect whether the macro works in a game or not (eg less than 50ms wait before keyup does not work in MWO)

2.4 9th Jul 2013
= Limit fire rate option now actually works - previously it was always on.

2.3 7th Jul 2013
= Weapon Toggle now disables correctly again

2.2 7th Jul 2013
+ Now detects change of resolution and when it gets smaller, resets and shuts off all timers.
In games that have a windowed mode lobby and a full-screen game - this should shut stuff off when you go back to the lobby.

2.1 7th Jul 2013
= Fixed app detection.
Will now disable timers and Weapon Toggle when the Limit App loses focus
