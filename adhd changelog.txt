1.3 10th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug where changing profiles would not change the setting of a binding if the new setting was "None".
Thus, settings could duplicate from one profile to another.
= Add mode now adds a blank profile, instead of just copying the current one.

1.2 7th Jul 2013
+ Added a new hook - resolution_change. Fires when the resolution of the "Limit app" window changes.

1.1 7th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug where app_active was being fired instead of app_inactive.
