+ : Added feature

1.6 15th Jul 2013
+ There is now a method ADHD.config_get_default_app_on() that can detect whether the "Limit App" feature is on
+ Copy and Rename profile input boxes now start populated with an appropriate value

1.5 14th Jul 2013
+ There is now a config option ADHD.config_ignore_noaction_warning() that allows you to make macros with no hotkeys

1.4 14th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug: If you disabled "Limit Application", the hotkey bindings would not work until you restarted the macro.
Also, hotkeys are now disabled in the "proper" way.

1.3 10th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug where changing profiles would not change the setting of a binding if the new setting was "None".
Thus, settings could duplicate from one profile to another.
= Add mode now adds a blank profile, instead of just copying the current one.

1.2 7th Jul 2013
+ Added a new hook - resolution_change. Fires when the resolution of the "Limit app" window changes.

1.1 7th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug where app_active was being fired instead of app_inactive.
