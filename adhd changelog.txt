2.3.0
= Moved to three number semantic versioning system
+ Version checks now regognise newer, older, or same number versions.
= option_changed removed from debug list - it provided no information
+ Debug log now scrolls as new items are added.

2.2 5th Jan 2014
= Fixed bindings tab a little - SPACE now works properly, BACKSPACE support restored.

2.1 7th Dec 2013
+ Added mechanism to detect INI version
  Used if you change format of INI file, and wish to warn users not to try to load an invalid profile
= Fixed bug:
  When copying a profile, then exiting would cause the original (not the copied) profile being loaded on next run

2.0 20th Nov 2013
+ Can now add more than just a main tab.
  Set ADHD.tab_list to an array of strings to add more tabs.
+ Added tab_change event hook
+ Added on_exit event hook that runs when the script closes
+ Added Update Notification system.
  You can specify ADHD.config_updates("<url>") to designate a URL where the script will look for a text file.
  The script then checks its version number against the contents of the text file (Looking for a "version=xxx" line)
= Gui is now not shown until ADHD.finish_startup() is called.

1.16 7th Oct 2013
= Fixes resolution_changed event to not fire on minimize / maximize event
  A bit of a bodgy fix for now (height <= 30px is considered minimized) as AHK not detecting state properly.

1.15 1st Oct 2013
= Fixed bug with profiles. When you changed profile, the old bindings were not being removed properly.
  This could cause some very odd behaviour, especially if running two copies of an ADHD macro

1.14 20th Sep 2013
+ Added "Functionality Toggle" binding to all macros. This highly requested feature will enable / disable all hotkeys.
= Fixed bug with binding keys - typing a letter into the keyboard box could cause the app to go nuts.

1.13 8th Sep 2013
= Fixed bug with binding modified (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) controls - eg trying to bind Ctrl+LMB would give an error.

1.12 6th Sep 2013
+ Added ability to bind Left Control, Alt or Shift by only ticking the modifier boxes

1.11 27th Aug 2013
+ New function: run_as_admin
  Ensures script is running as admin

1.10 20th Aug 2013
= Fixed bug - if you close an ADHD app while it is minimized,
  the window no longer disappears off-screen next time you load

1.9 11th Aug 2013
= If none of the CTRL, Shift or Alt options in the Bindings tab are ticked for a binding,
 then it will work even if CTRL, Shift or Alt are held down

1.8 15th Jul 2013
= The tooltip system now works again

1.7 15th Jul 2013
= The help link is no longer hard wired to fire control
+ There is now a help parameter in config_about to allow you to configure seperate homepage and help pages

1.6 15th Jul 2013
+ There is now a method ADHD.config_get_default_app_on() that can detect whether the "Limit App" feature is on
+ Copy and Rename profile input boxes now start populated with an appropriate value
+ The profile select box is now wider to accomodate longer profile names

1.5 14th Jul 2013
+ There is now a config option ADHD.config_ignore_noaction_warning() that allows you to make macros with no hotkeys

1.4 14th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug: If you disabled "Limit Application", the hotkey bindings would not work until you restarted the macro.
Also, hotkeys are now disabled in the "proper" way.

1.3 10th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug where changing profiles would not change the setting of a binding if the new setting was "None".
Thus, settings could duplicate from one profile to another.
= Add mode now adds a blank profile, instead of just copying the current one.

1.2 7th Jul 2013
+ Added a new hook - resolution_change. Fires when the resolution of the "Limit app" window changes.

1.1 7th Jul 2013
= Fixed bug where app_active was being fired instead of app_inactive.
